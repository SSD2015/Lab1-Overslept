#Vision Statement

  For this project, the customers are teachers and students. They want to find the way to review subjects. So, we create the game like jeopardy to review the subject. The game will contain the topic which teachers want to add. In one game, it will contain about 30 problems which random from the database or he/she can add more questions about that subjects. They will seperate in categories and level. The players will get the points upon the level of problems. The games will online so that students can play in differrent place but in the same time. After select the question, players who push the button first will get the chance to answer. If it is correct, player will get points otherwise will lose points. When finish game, it will rank the score with all players.
